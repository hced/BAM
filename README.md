# Blender Add-on Manager

Blender Add-on Manager is a (currently only an imaginary) tool for managing add-on updates in [Blender](https://www.blender.org). The goal is to provide a method that gets adopted as standard means for keeping installed add-ons up to date.

Arguably, there's a long-standing problem pertaining to how users stay on top of new releases for their installed add-ons. None of the current routes are efficient (email notifications, forum announcements, built-in update code). They're either labor intensive, or introduce redundant code and potential performance bottlenecks, if many add-ons were to implement self-updating code. This ultimately leads to potential confusion, and things like 1-star reviews based on situations where the user hasn't installed new versions containing fixes to their complaints and similar.

So let's fix this!

Anyone who's willing to help out is more than welcome to jump in and contribute to the project (be that coding, planning or anything else). The idea started as a proposal on [Right-Click Select](https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/qlhbbc/). Now there's also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rz4GHt57) for effective communication. Anyone's welcome to join in!
